          Frequently Asked Questions
        </h1>
        <h4>How do I join the club?</h4>
        <p>
          Simply show up to one of our training sessions and approach one of our
          friendly execs!
        </p>
        <h4>Are beginners allowed?</h4>
        <p>
          Beginners are most definitely welcome! Most people who have joined
          have little to no experience with boxing.
        </p>
        <h4>Do you offer free trials?</h4>
        <p>
          The first two classes are free. After which you can choose to pay
          either by the semester or by the year.

        <h4>Do I need to bring my own equipment?</h4>
        <p>
          The club provides equipment to get you started. However, it is
          strongly encouraged for members to purchase their own handwraps and
          gloves. You will need your own mouthguard to spar (optional).

        <h4>
